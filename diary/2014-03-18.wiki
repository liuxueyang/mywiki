There are so many amazing techniques that I want to learn.
But I must choose some special and learn it all the way.
Maybe someday I will know that I should not learn everything
because when you know something very well you will learn another
thing without much effort.

I learn some Emacs at noon and I find I prefer to use vim.

{{{
  Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
   In the forests of the night,
    What immortal hand or eye
     Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
  In what distant deeps or skies
   Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
    On what wings dare he aspire?
     What the hand dare sieze the fire?

         print("Hello {0} number {1}".format(world, x))

    This would be a blockquote in vimwiki. It is not highlighted in vim but
    could be styled by CSS in HTML. Blockquotes are usually used to quote a
    long piece of text from another source.
