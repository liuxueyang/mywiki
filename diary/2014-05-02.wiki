Today, I go back to school from HenMountain.
So tired and hungery.
I will not go out on holiday forever!
Maybe I should read more and experience something
interesting.
At night, I bought many books on society, technology,
	 and economics.
I buy a few of Kindle books and think that it is 
better to pay for goods although they are electric books.
